## Minimal Build Example (using containers with buildah)

Here we give a minimal build example using a linux container, setting environment variables "manually" and running a series of commands.

This example does NOT use a remote sftp cache of built packages or downloaded source tarballs.
It does also not rely on any ssh configuration or special accounts to be created.

### Dependencies on host system

```
$ sudo apt install buildah
```

If you wish to build for an architecture other than your current one you can install `qemu-user-static` and specify a different architecture's container image such as `arm64v8/ubuntu:22.04`.
(https://hub.docker.com/r/arm64v8/ubuntu/) or from other repositories TODO
